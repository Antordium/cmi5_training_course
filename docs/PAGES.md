# Github page hosted

1. static site build and obfuscate
2. publish build to github pages (technically could be any static site hosting)
3. update cmi5.xml to the github pages url
4. publish cmi5.xml to lms


Also - here's a starter template we have for validating cmi5 content :)
https://github.com/uki-code/od360-content-starter

should be it :)
